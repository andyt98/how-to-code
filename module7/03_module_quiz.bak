;; BST is one of:

;; interp. false means no BST, or empty BST
;;         key is the node key
;;         val is the node val
;;         l and r are left and right subtrees

;;     key is > all keys in its l(eft)  child
;;     key is < all keys in its r(ight) child
;;     the same key never appears twice in the tree
